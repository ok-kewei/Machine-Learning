Linear Regression with Single Variable
First, we uses homeprices.csv file to build a model. 
Then to use the model we built, we importing area.csv file. 
Prediction.csv file created by adding Price column in area.csv file, that is to predict home prices by area input that we feed it. 
Area is independant variable, X. Price is dependant variable, Y. 
Linear Regression algorithm, Y = MX + C, M is the linear slope and C is y-intercept, when X = 0.
